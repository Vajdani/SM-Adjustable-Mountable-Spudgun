# NORMAL VERSION
This mod adds a spudgun that you can adjust in various ways.
**Just interact with the gun and begin tuning it however you'd like**!

You can also create templates out of the guns! **Just press U on the gun you want to make a template of, press E on another gun and click the template button**! You can also switch templates by connecting another logic input. It will inherit the template gun's stats and everything! You can have multiple templates.


# HANDHELD VERSION
I also made a handheld version! **Press 'R' to open the tuning menu!** Sadly, **you can't make templates of it, but you can use templates created by normal adjustable guns!**
